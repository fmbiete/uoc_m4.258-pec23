          <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
            horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
            belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.</p>

          <p>The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
            pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's
            happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.</p>

          <p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
            walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and
            above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
            nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a
            heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out
            the window at the dull weather. Drops</p>

          <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
            enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for
            the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
            tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p>

          <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a
            greater artist than now.</p>

          <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface
            of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I
            throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a
            thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and
            grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of
            the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and
            sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness
            overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of
            a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could
            impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul,
            as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!</p>

            visions! A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring

      <p>Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive
        translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common
        words.</p>

      <p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of
        the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European
        languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.</p>

      <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
        will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
        truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</p>

      <p>No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
        know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</p>

      <p>Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
        because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take
        a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage
        from it?</p>

      <p>But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
        consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce
        with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
        the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee</p>
